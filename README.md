# KamuriBot
Learning purpose only!

# Usage
The bot isn't currently online, so I can't get you to use it.\n
But if you want to create your own bot using mine as base, go on.

# The current commands on the bot:
/start
The /start command every bot has.
/search
Search over Wikipedia in my language (which in case is portuguese, but you can chance anytime).
/download "the title of the video"
Searchs over Youtube to find the video the user wants, then shows a list of buttons.
The user can choose one option with the buttons and the bot will download it.
This function is actually imcomplete, as the bot doesn't send the music to the user.

# Further notes
As you can see, the bot stills in developement. Soon as I can see at least a low level of utility
for it, I'll be trying to deploy it somewhere, so be aware that it might become something over control
that tries to end with all the human live on the Earth
